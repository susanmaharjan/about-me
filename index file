Su-sun Maharjan, section 01, 11 am, Dr. Case

This is my third year at Northwest Missouri State University am I am a senior working on my Bachelor of Science with Major in Computer Science and Minor on System Management. I am expecting to graduate in December 2020.

I am from Kathmandu, Nepal. I love playing my bamboo flute which is called “Bansuri”. I like to travel to different places. I have been to 6 countries so far. Nepal, United States, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and India. I like going hiking, cycling and doing adventure sports. I have done parasailing, white water rafting, canoeing and gone trekking up till 4500 meters above sea level so far. In my bucket list, I want to do bungee jumping, sky diving, scuba diving and go to Everest base camp.

I got interested in computer science because I wanted to become a full stack developer who can develop both front end and back end of applications. As I have been taking different classes, I am also interested in working with database and software designing and software architecture. After I graduate, I want to start my career as a full-stack developer.
